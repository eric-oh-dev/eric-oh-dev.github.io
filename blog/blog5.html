        <h3>My understanding of Emotional Intelligence</h3>

        <h4>IQ vs EQ: What's the Difference, and Why Does It Matter?</h4>
        <p>
          When I started learning to code, I thought everything would be about
          logic, math, and problem-solving. Basically — IQ stuff. And while
          that’s definitely part of it, I quickly realized that technical skills
          aren’t the whole picture. There’s another type of intelligence that
          plays a huge role in how we learn, collaborate, and grow: EQ, or
          Emotional Intelligence. <br />
          So what’s the difference between IQ and EQ — and why do we need both?
        </p>
        <h4>What is IQ?</h4>
        <p>
          IQ (Intelligence Quotient) is probably what most of us think of when
          we hear the word “smart.” It measures your cognitive abilities — like
          how well you reason, solve problems, remember things, and understand
          abstract ideas. A high IQ might mean you’re good at: <br />
          - Solving tricky puzzles <br />
          - Analysing patterns <br />
          - Learning new technical concepts quickly <br />
          In coding, IQ helps you figure out how to fix a bug, write efficient
          code, and learn programming languages.
        </p>
        <h4>What is EQ?</h4>
        <p>
          EQ (Emotional Intelligence) is your ability to understand and manage
          emotions — both your own and other people’s. It includes things like:
          <br />
          - Self-awareness (knowing what you're feeling and why) <br />
          - Empathy (understanding how others feel) <br />
          - Emotional regulation (handling stress or frustration) <br />
          - Communication (expressing yourself clearly and kindly) <br />
          In a team environment - like a coding bootcamp or tech job - EQ helps
          you: <br />
          - Work through conflicts or misunderstandings <br />
          - Support your teammates when they're stuck <br />
          - Handle feedback with a growth mindset <br />
          - Stay calm and focused under pressure
        </p>
        <h4>Why EQ Matters in Tech</h4>
        <p>
          Tech might seem like a field where only IQ matters — but that couldn’t
          be further from the truth. So much of modern development is
          team-based. You’re working with others, pair programming, reviewing
          each other’s code, and communicating across roles (like designers,
          testers, and stakeholders). <br />
          Here’s the thing: you might be able to build the perfect app on your
          own, but if you can’t collaborate, adapt to change, or deal with
          stress — it’s going to be tough to thrive in the real world.
        </p>
        <h4>Can You Improve EQ?</h4>
        <p>
          Yes! While IQ tends to be more fixed, EQ can be developed through
          practice and self-reflection. Here are a few ways I’ve been working on
          mine: <br />
          - Journaling when I feel frustrated or stuck <br />
          - aking breaks to reset during intense coding sessions <br />
          - Practicing active listening with peers <br />
          - Asking for feedback — and learning how to take it constructively
          <br />
          These little habits make a big difference over time.
        </p>
        <h4>Final Thoughts</h4>
        <p>
          IQ and EQ aren’t in competition — they’re two sides of the same coin.
          To be a well-rounded developer (and human), you need both: the ability
          to solve problems and the ability to navigate the emotional side of
          learning and teamwork. <br />
          Whether you're debugging code or talking through a tough day with your
          team, developing both types of intelligence will take you further than
          either one alone.
