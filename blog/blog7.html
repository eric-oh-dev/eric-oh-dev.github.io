        <h2>Te Whare Tapa Wha</h2>
        <h3>My wellbeing plan using Te Whare Tapa Wha model</h3>
        <h3>16 April 2025</h3>
        <h4>My Wellbeing Plan - Te Whare Tapa Wha</h4>
        <p>
          Learning something as big as web development can feel like a
          rollercoaster. To stay grounded and grow well, I’m using Te Whare Tapa
          Whā—a Māori model of wellbeing that helps me check in with all parts
          of who I am: body, mind, spirit, and relationships. When all four
          walls of my whare (house) are strong, I feel strong too.
        </p>
        <h4>Taha Tinana -0 Physical Wellbeing</h4>
        <p>
          How my body grows, feels, and moves. <br />
          To support my taha tinana, I will: <br />
          - Start each day with some light stretching or a short walk to wate my
          body up. <br />
          - Take regular breaks while studying to move my body and avoid sitting
          for too long. <br />
          - Prepare simple, healthy meals that give me consistent energy
          throughout the day. <br />
          - Keep a good sleep routine - even if I'm up late debugging! Rested
          body = sharper mind. <br />
          Why it matters: When my body feels good , it's so much easier to stay
          focused , deal with stress, and enjoy learning.
        </p>
        <h4>Taha Hinengaro - Mental & Emotional Wellbeing</h4>
        <p>
          My thoughts, emotions, and how I handle them. <br />
          To support my taha hinengaro, I will: <br />
          - Practice self-compassion: remind myself it's okay to make mistakes -
          it's part of learning <br />
          - Journal daily to reflect on challenges, wins, and how I'm feeling.
          <br />
          - Use mindfulness or breathing techniques when I feel overwhelmed.
          <br />
          - Stay aware of what I eat and how it affects my mood and focus.
          <br />
          Why it matters: Learning to code can be mentally tough - so staying
          emotionally grounded helps me stay motivated and not spiral when
          things get tricky.
        </p>
        <h4>Taha Wairua - Spiritual Wellbeing</h4>
        <p>
          My sense of meaning, purpose, and connection to something greater.
          <br />
          To support my taha wairua, I will: <br />
          - Reflect on why I chose this path - what drives me and what kind of
          developer I want to be. <br />
          - Spend quite time outdoors, even just sitting under a tree or
          listening to birds. <br />
          - Practice gratitude - writing down 3 things I'm thankful for each
          week. <br />
          - Honour my own values and let them guide how I interact with others
          and my work. <br />
          Why it matters: When I feel connected to something bigger than myself
          - my purpose, nature, the universe - I feel more at peace and
          grounded.
        </p>
        <h4>Taha Whanau - Family & Social Wellbeing</h4>
        <p>
          The people I care about and who care about me. <br />
          To support my taha whanau, I will: <br />
          - Make time for calls or catch-ups with friends and whanau, even
          during busy weeks. <br />
          - Share my learning journey with people I trust - let them encourage
          me.<br />
          - Be open to forming new connections with my cohort and see them as
          part of my learning whanau. <br />
          - Offer help to others when I can - it strengthens both them and me.
          <br />
          Why it matters: I'm not in this alone. Being supported and staying
          connected gives me strength and reminds me who I'm doing this for.
        </p>
        <h4>Whenua - Land & Connection to Nature</h4>
        <p>
          The foundation that grounds all the walls of my whare. <br />
          To strengthen my connection to whenua, I will: <br />
          - Take study breaks outside - even just 5 mintues in the sun or fresh
          air. <br />
          - Notice and appreciate the nature around me: birds, flowers, the
          wind, the sky. <br />
          - Visit local parks, beaches, or maunga when I need to rest. <br />
          - Acknowledge the whenua I'm learning on, and reflect on my place in
          Aotearoa. <br />
          Why it matters: Spending time in nature keeps me grounded. It reminds
          me I'm part of something bigger, and that there's calm even in chaos.
        </p>
        <h4>Final Thoughts</h4>
        <p>
          Te Whare Tapa Wha reminds me that I'm more than just a student
          learning code - I'm a whole person. When I care for my body, my mind,
          my spirit, my relationships, and my connection to the land, I give
          myself the best chance to thrive - at Dev Academy and beyond.
