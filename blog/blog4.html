        <h2>JS Fundamentals</h2>
        <h3>JavaScript and it's relationship to HTML and CSS</h3>
        <h3>11 April 2025</h3>

        <p>
          Learning to code is like trying to speak a new language with three
          different dialects - HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I had no idea how they
          all worked together or what things like "control flow" or "the DOM"
          meant. <br />
          Here's how I've come to understand them - and how I'd explain them to
          a friend who's curious about what I've been learningl
        </p>
        <h4>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript: The Holy Trinity of the Web</h4>
        <p>
          A website is like a house <br />
          - HTML is the structure - the walls, doors, and layout of your house.
          <br />
          - CSS is the paint and furniture - it makes everything look nice.
          <br />
          - JavaScript is the electricity and plumbing - it makes things do
          stuff, like turning on lights when you press a switch. <br />
          Without JavaScript, your website might look great, but it won't be
          interactive. With JavaScript, buttons can respond when clicked, forms
          can be validated, and pages can update without refreshing.
        </p>
        <h4>Control Flow & Loops - Like Making a Cup of Tea</h4>
        <p>
          Control flow is the order in which your code runs - kind of like a
          recipe. Sometimes you do things stop by stop, sometimes you make
          decisions (if statements), and sometimes you repeat actions (loops).
          <br />
          1. Boil water <br />
          2. If you have a teabag, put it in the cup -> else, go to the shop and
          buy teabags <br />
          3. pour hot water into the cup <br />
          4. Wait 3 minutes <br />
          5. Add milk if you want it <br />
          6. Stir and enjoy! <br />
          Now imagine doing this for 5 people - you'd probably use a loop!
        </p>

        </div>
        <h4>The DOM: Your Website's Blueprint That JavaScript Can Change</h4>
        <p>
          The DOM (Document Object Model) is like a live map of your website's
          HTML. JavaScript can use this map to read, change, or delete things on
          the page. <br />
          Let's say you have a button and want it to say "Clicked!" when someone
          presses it. JavaScript lets you grab that button and change what it
          says:
        </p>
        <div class="ex2">
          <img src="../images/ex-2.png" alt="ex2" />
          <img src="../images/ex-3.png" alt="ex3" />
        </div>
        <h4>Arrays vs Objects: Boxes and Labelled Drawers</h4>
        <p>
          An array is like a row of boxes, where each box has a number. You use
          the number (index) to get the item.
        </p>
        <div class="ex2">
          <img src="../images/ex-4.png" alt="ex4" />
        </div>
        <p>
          An object is more like a drawer with labels - you use a name (key) to
          access each item.
        </p>
        <div class="ex2">
          <img src="../images/ex-5.png" alt="ex5" />
        </div>
        <p>
          Use arrays when order matters, and objects when you need key-value
          pairs.
        </p>
        <h4>What Are Functions and Why Do We Use Them?</h4>
        <p>
          Functions are like little machines or routines. You give them
          instructions, and then you can reuse those instructions anytime
          without rewriting them.
        </p>
        <div class="ex2">
          <img src="../images/ex-6.png" alt="ex6" />
        </div>
        <p>
          Instead of writing "Hello, ___!" over and over again, you create one
          function, and then just call it when you need it. Functions help make
          your code reusable, clean, and easier to read.
