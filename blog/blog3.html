          How will I operate within Dev Academy Foundations and Bootcamp

        <h4>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h4>
        <p>
          My goal is to become a web developer. I’m aiming to gain the technical
          and professional skills needed to work confidently as a junior
          developer, with a focus on front-end and full-stack development. I
          want to be part of a team where I can grow, contribute, and eventually
          mentor others entering the field.
        </p>
        <h4>
          A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to
          learning
        </h4>
        <p>
          Strengths: I’m a strong problem-solver who enjoys breaking challenges
          down into smaller parts and working through them step by step. I also
          have solid logical thinking skills, which helps me understand how
          different pieces of code interact and how to structure solutions that
          make sense.<br />
          Limitations: One of my biggest challenges is perfectionism — I often
          spend too much time trying to get things exactly right, which can slow
          me down. Hence my second limitation, time management. I especially
          struggle with time management when balancing multiple tasks or when a
          project takes longer than expected. I'm working on being more mindful
          of deadlines and trusting that progress is more important than
          perfection.
        </p>
        <h4>
          What skills (non-technical/human skills) would you like to see
          developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
        </h4>
        <p>
          While I'm focused on building my technical skills, I also want to grow
          in three key human skill areas: <br />
          Communication: I want to become more confident in expressing my ideas
          clearly, asking questions when I need help, and giving and receiving
          constructive feedback effectively. <br />
          Resilience & Growth Mindset: I want to get better at handling
          challenges without getting discouraged. I’m working on viewing
          mistakes as learning opportunities rather than setbacks. <br />
          Collaboration & Teamwork: I aim to be an open and supportive team
          member. I want to practice sharing responsibilities, listening
          actively, and contributing positively to group work.
        </p>
        <h4>
          A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.
        </h4>
        <p>
          To manage my workload during the programme, I’ll set clear goals for
          myself and stay organized using whatever tools or methods help me stay
          on track. I’ll make sure to communicate regularly with my peers and
          facilitators, and contribute positively to group projects by listening
          actively and being a reliable teammate. When things get overwhelming
          or stressful, I’ll: <br />
          Take short breaks to reset and clear my mind — this might be a quick
          walk, some deep breathing, or stretching. <br />
          Reflect and journal to help process frustration and understand what’s
          going on internally. <br />
          Pair with another learner to talk through problems, both for support
          and to strengthen understanding. <br />
          Ask for help early instead of staying stuck — I’ll reach out to
          facilitators or peers as soon as I feel blocked.
        </p>
        <h4>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h4>
        <p>
          I hope the facilitation team will be approachable and available when I
          need help or guidance, and that I’ll feel comfortable reaching out
          when I’m stuck or unsure. I’d also appreciate emotional support during
          moments when the workload or content feels overwhelming — even just
          having someone to talk things through with can make a big difference.
          <br />
          I’m looking to be challenged to grow, think more critically, and push
          outside of my comfort zone as a learner and as a person. Finally, I’d
          like support in preparing for life after Dev Academy, including job
          readiness, what to expect from industry roles, and how to continue
          growing after the programme.
