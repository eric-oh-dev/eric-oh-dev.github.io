        <h2>Identity, Values, and Strengths Exploration</h2>
        <h3>Who am I and what I bring to the table</h3>
        <h3>10 November 2010</h3>

        <h4>
          Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss
          how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision
          you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.
        </h4>
        <p>
          When I was younger, there was a situation where a group of friends
          pressured me to steal candies from a supermarket, I was faced with a
          difficult ethical decision. I weighed values like honesty, respect for
          others, personal integrity, and the pressure to fit in with my
          friends. Choosing not to participate meant prioritizing my principles
          over peer pressure, which felt uncomfortable but ultimately aligned
          with my values. Reflecting on this decision now, I feel proud of
          standing firm in my integrity, as it strengthened my ability to resist
          peer pressure and trust my own judgment. The experience taught me the
          importance of making ethical decisions, even when it’s challenging,
          and how to navigate situations where values are tested.

        <h4>
          Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced
          your values and identity.
        </h4>
        <p>
          My journey of moving from Korea to New Zealand at a young age brought
          together different cultural influences that shaped my values and
          identity. Growing up in Korea, I have been raised with strong values
          such as respect for family, community, and tradition, which are
          central to Korean culture. These values often emphasize hard work,
          loyalty, and honoring one’s elders, all of which have been instilled
          in me from an early age. When I moved to New Zealand, the culture
          shift introduced new perspectives on individuality, diversity, and
          openness. The Kiwi culture encouraged a more laid-back, egalitarian
          approach to life, where people are generally friendly, open-minded,
          and value personal freedom. Over time, these cultural elements
          influenced how I balance the traditional values from my Korean
          upbringing with the more relaxed, inclusive attitudes I encountered in
          New Zealand. The blending of both cultures helped me create a unique
          identity that honors my roots while embracing the diversity and
          opportunities that New Zealand offers.
        </p>
        <h4>
          Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your
          learning journey.
        </h4>
        <p>
          Having moved from Korea to New Zealand at a young age, I’ve developed
          the ability to adapt to new environments and cultures. This ability
          will help me navigate different learning styles, tackle new
          challenges, and embrace diverse perspectives as I continue my
          education. Also rooted in Korean culture, the value of hard work and
          persistence is often emphasized. This work ethic will be a powerful
          tool in pushing through difficult tasks, staying focused, and
          consistently striving for improvement, even when faced with
          challenges.
        </p>
        <h4>
          Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career
          development. How might these affect your learning journey?
        </h4>
        <p>
          With everything I've discussed so far, I tend to strive for perfection
          and sometimes this could be my limitation. It's often the case that I
          would procrastinate. I'm afraid of producing imperfect work and delay
          starting a task, thinking that I need everything to be just right
          before I begin. In other cases I would spend too much time on small
          details, neglecting the bigger picture. I find myself working
          excessively on tasks, which can lead to exhaustion and stress.
        </p>
        <h4>
          Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with
          others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you
          tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on
          what other strategies you would try now and why.
        </h4>
        <p>
          When I was in University working on a group project, I had dealt with
          a group member who promises to contribute but doesn't follow through.
          This situation created tension within the team and hindered the
          overall progress of the project. I've tried to clearly communicate the
          importance of each person contributing their fair share. Also directly
          asked the member about their contributions, checked in on their
          progress, and expressed how it affects the group as a whole. My final
          resource was having a group check-in but the member only showed up
          once and was never seen again. Finally the problem was resolved by
          kicking the member out of the group and getting an extension on our
          project. To be honest, I don't think trying other strategies would
          have been effective but maybe providing support and having frequent
          group check-in would've been more motivating for the team.
